# Location-Based-Privacy

This is a final year(7th semester) project done at BMS College of Engineering.

Refer to Report-Final.pdf for full details.

This is a prototype for implementing location privacy using two methods:
1. Location Obfuscation: Choose a nearby location and use it instead of the user location.
2. K-Anonymity: Use k-1 dummies close to user location

EXAMPLES:
====================================================================================================
Location Obfuscation:
This method gave a generalized area or the locality of the user's location for all the
locations.
Some of the examples are:
1. User's Location: 
        Kempe Gowda tower atop twin boulders., B M S College of Law Road, Basavanagudi, Bengaluru, Karnataka 560004, India.
   Obfuscated Location generated: 
        Basavanagudi, Bengaluru. 
2. User's Location: 
        Railway Station Rd, Malmaddi, Dharwad, Karnataka 580001, India
   Obfuscated Location generated: 
        Malmaddi, Dharwad.
3. User's Location: 
        Hanamsagar Road, Hanamsagar, Karnataka 583281, India
    Obfuscated Location: 
        Hanamasagar.

The location obfuscation will work at all kinds of places â€“ City, Town, Village, etc.

====================================================================================================

k-Anonymity :
The method generates k-1 dummy locations and merges those locations with the
user's location to form a set of k similar locations. Then these locations can be used to query
the LBS.

10. North Public Square Road, Basavanagudi, Bengaluru, Karnataka 560004, India

The different tries conducted show that at k=10, a user location is well hidden among 10 locations and the position of the user location never is the same. Also, the other 9 locations keep on changing confirming the effectiveness of the algorithm.
